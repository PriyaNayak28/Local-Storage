# Local-Storage

## Description

This is a simple web application that allows users to **add**, **edit**, and **delete** their contact information, including **name**, **email**, and **phone number**. The data is stored in the browser's **Local Storage**, ensuring that it persists even after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is a great way to practice working with the DOM and Local Storage.

## Features

- **Add Contact**: Enter a name, email, and phone number to add a new contact.
- **Edit Contact**: Modify existing contact details.
- **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: Contact information is stored in Local Storage for persistence across page reloads.

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
